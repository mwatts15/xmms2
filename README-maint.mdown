How to update waf
-----------------

Here is the step-by-step:

1. Add new version and (invalid) hash to `utils/wafgen.conf`
2. Run `utils/wafgen`
3. Update `utils/wafgen.conf` with a new hash
4. Run `utils/wafgen`
5. Update `_waf_hexversion = ` in `wscript`.
6. Commit the result: `git commit utils/wafgen.conf wscript waf`

Done!

How to cut a new release
------------------------

There are a few steps as well:

1. Update `BASEVERSION=` in wscript to name new release.
2. Update `NEWS` file to mention highlights and set today's release date.
3. Run `utils/tag-xmms2.sh`: it will extract the tag from `BASEVERSION`
   and will propose `git `commands to run.
4. Run proposed `git` commands to create the commit and a tag.
5. Run `utils/gen-tarball.py` to generate release tarball.
6. Push the release commit and tag: `git push --tags origin master`.
7. Create the release out of pushed tag and upload resulting release
   tarball via github UI.
